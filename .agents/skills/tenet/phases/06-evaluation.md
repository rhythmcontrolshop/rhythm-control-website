# Phase 6: Evaluation

The evaluation pipeline ensures that all implemented work meets both mechanical requirements and the original intent. It enforces a strict separation between the author and the critic to prevent leniency.

## Finding Categories

Every critic finding (code critic, test critic) MUST include a `category` so the orchestrator can route fix work correctly instead of blindly retrying the source job:

| Category | Meaning | Orchestrator action |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| `product_bug` | Implementation does not match spec intent | Retry the source dev job |
| `test_bug` | Tests assert wrong thing or would pass when they should fail | Spawn a test-fix job (strengthen/replace the asserting test) |
| `harness_bug` | Build/lint/test harness itself is broken | Spawn a harness-fix job (may touch `tests/`, CI config, scripts) |
| `evidence_mismatch` | Report numbers don't match fresh command output | Re-run the source job's verification commands, refresh report |
| `contention` | Failure looks like sibling eval stepping on shared state | Re-run after siblings complete, or switch to sequential mode |
| `scope_conflict` | Job edited files outside its declared scope (e.g. report-only job touched code) | Trigger the remediation escape hatch (see 05-execution-loop.md) |

The critic emits findings as objects: `{"category": "...", "detail": "..."}`. Orchestrators MUST read the category to pick the right response — plain retry loops waste cycles on bugs that aren't product bugs.

## Playwright Layer 2 Honesty

The Playwright eval returns a `layer2_status` field so downstream readers can distinguish "fully verified" from "Layer 1 only":

- `completed` — Layer 2 exploratory testing ran via Playwright MCP. Findings reflect real interactive use.
- `skipped_no_mcp` — Playwright MCP was not installed. Only scripted (Layer 1) results are reported.
- `failed` — Layer 2 was attempted but could not complete (app wouldn't start, MCP errors).

`tenet_get_status` surfaces the latest completed playwright_eval's `layer2_status` as `latest_playwright_layer2_status` so final reports can state honestly whether visual verification happened. A "passed" verdict with `layer2_status: skipped_no_mcp` is NOT the same as fully verified — say so in the final report.

## Parallel vs Sequential Critics

The three critic jobs (code critic, test critic, Playwright eval) may run **in parallel** or **sequentially**, decided by the readiness gate verdict (`eval_parallel_safe:{feature}` in the config table):

- **Parallel** (verdict `true`) — pure libraries, CLIs, data pipelines with no shared mutable state. Critics start concurrently; completion time ≈ slowest single critic.
- **Sequential** (verdict `false` or missing) — stateful web apps where critics would collide on shared state (DB rows, sessions, rate-limit counters, ports, Playwright lock dirs). Critics run code → test → playwright. The caller still receives all three job IDs up front; job-manager auto-dispatches each downstream critic when its predecessor completes.

`tenet_start_eval` reads the verdict automatically — no orchestrator code change needed. If the verdict is missing, Tenet defaults to sequential (safe fallback).

## The 5 Evaluation Stages

### Stage 1: Mechanical
Automated checks with no human judgment. Run these commands and verify exit codes:
- **Lint**: Run the project linter from harness config.
- **Build**: Execute the build command.
- **Type-check**: Verify types across the changed files.
- **Tests**: Run the full test suite (unit + acceptance tests if they exist).
**PASS**: All exit 0. **FAIL**: Any non-zero exit code.

### Stage 1.5: Smoke Check (MANDATORY for dev jobs)
After mechanical checks pass, verify the implementation actually works at runtime:

**For server/API features:**
1. Start the application server
2. Hit each relevant API endpoint with a basic request
3. Verify non-5xx responses (200, 201, 301, 404 are OK — 500 is a fail)
4. Stop the server

**For frontend features:**
1. Start the dev server
2. Navigate to each relevant page
3. Verify pages render without console errors or blank screens
4. If Playwright is available, run `npx playwright test` against acceptance tests

**For CLI/library features:**
1. Run the CLI with basic arguments
2. Verify exit code and output format

**PASS**: Server starts, endpoints respond, pages render. **FAIL**: Server won't start, endpoints return 500, pages are blank/error.

A smoke check failure is a Stage 1 failure — the job cannot pass eval.

### Stage 2: Property-based
If the harness or spec defines property tests, run them now. These properties must predate the implementation. Skip if no property tests exist.

### Stage 3: Code Critic (Independent Context)
A separate agent session with no prior implementation history performs this review. It receives the spec, scenarios, harness, and the diff, but never the author's reasoning or prior conversation.

The code critic checks:
- Does the implementation match the spec's intent?
- Are any anti-scenarios violated?
- Are there obvious gaps or missing edge cases?

**Zero-findings rule**: If the critic finds nothing, it must re-analyze using an alternate attack vector like security, performance, or concurrency. Zero findings trigger a mandatory second pass.

Then performs structured self-questioning:
- **Edge cases**: Empty input? Max values? Unicode?
- **Error paths**: Dependency failures? Timeouts? Disk full?
- **Integration**: Does this break upstream or downstream components?
- **Security**: Input validation? Secret exposure? Injection?
- **Performance**: N+1 queries? Unbounded loops? Memory leaks?

### Stage 4: Test Critic (Independent Context)
A separate agent session reviews whether the tests are **sufficient to prove the features actually work**. It receives the spec, scenarios, and acceptance/integration test files — NOT the implementation code.

The test critic checks:
- For each scenario: is there a test that covers it?
- Does each test verify the **correct outcome**, not just absence of errors?
  - BAD: `expect(page).not.toHaveURL(/error/)` — passes even if login redirects back to login
  - GOOD: `expect(page).toHaveURL(/dashboard/)` — fails if login doesn't actually work
- After login: does the test verify session persists across reload?
- After create: does the test verify the item appears in a list/view?
- After form submit: does the test verify redirect to the correct destination?
- Are there routes/pages/endpoints with NO test coverage at all?
- Are there interactive elements (buttons, forms) with no test?

If tests are insufficient, the test critic outputs specific tests that need to be added or strengthened. These become requirements for a fix job before the integration checkpoint can pass.

## Integration Test Evaluation

Integration test jobs (`integration_test` type) have a different eval flow:
1. The integration test agent runs acceptance tests and reports results
2. If ALL tests pass → job completes successfully
3. If ANY test fails → job fails with detailed failure report
4. On failure, the orchestrator creates targeted fix jobs for each failure
5. After fix jobs complete, the integration test is retried

The orchestrator should parse the integration test output to identify specific failures and create focused fix jobs rather than retrying the entire feature.

## Evaluation Result Format
Record results via `tenet_update_knowledge` with a descriptive title. Example: `title="eval project-scaffold mechanical-and-spec-compliance"`. The tool generates a dated markdown file in `.tenet/knowledge/`.

```markdown
# Evaluation: job-{id}

## Stage 1: Mechanical
- lint: PASS/FAIL
- build: PASS/FAIL
- typecheck: PASS/FAIL
- tests: PASS/FAIL (N/M passed)

## Stage 1.5: Smoke Check
- server start: PASS/FAIL
- endpoint /api/xxx: PASS/FAIL (status code)
- page /xxx: PASS/FAIL (renders/error)

## Stage 3: Code Critic
- Finding 1: Description
- Zero-findings recheck: [done/not-needed]
- Self-questioning results: [edge cases/security/performance]

## Stage 4: Test Critic
- Scenario coverage: [N/M scenarios have tests]
- Outcome verification: PASS/FAIL (tests verify outcomes, not just absence of errors)
- Missing tests: [list of tests that need to be added]
- Insufficient assertions: [list of tests that need stronger assertions]

## Overall: PASS / FAIL
```

## Handling Failures
- **Stage 1/1.5 Fail**: Fix the mechanical/runtime issue immediately.
- **Stage 3 Fail (Code Critic)**: Run reflection to find the root cause, then retry via `tenet_retry_job` (preferred) or create a new job if the approach is fundamentally wrong.
- **Stage 4 Fail (Test Critic)**: Create a fix job to add/strengthen the tests identified by the critic, then re-run the integration checkpoint.
- **Integration test Fail**: Create targeted fix jobs, then retry the integration test.
- **Limits**: Max 3 retries per job before marking it as blocked.

### Stage 5: Playwright E2E (Two Layers, Independent Job)

Dispatched as a separate `playwright_eval` job by `tenet_start_eval` alongside code critic and test critic. The worker has independent context — does NOT see implementation code or author reasoning. Receives only the spec and the running application.

**The worker MUST do BOTH layers:**

#### Layer 1: Scripted Playwright Tests (regression)
1. Locate existing Playwright test files (`tests/e2e/`, `e2e/`, `tests/playwright/`)
2. Ensure the application is running (start dev server or docker compose)
3. Run `npx playwright test` (or the project's test command)
4. Report pass/fail counts and any failing tests

#### Layer 2: Exploratory Agent-Driven Testing (Playwright MCP)
The worker uses Playwright MCP tools to interact with the app like a real user:
- `playwright_navigate(url)` — go to a page
- `playwright_click(selector)` — click buttons/links
- `playwright_fill(selector, value)` — fill form fields
- `playwright_screenshot()` — capture state visually
- `playwright_get_visible_text()` — verify text content

**For each scenario in scope, the worker:**
1. Navigates to the entry point
2. Performs the user actions (click, fill, submit)
3. Takes screenshots at each step
4. Verifies the EXPECTED OUTCOME (not just absence of errors):
   - After login: did the URL change to /dashboard? Is user info visible?
   - After create: does the new item appear in the list?
   - After form submit: did it redirect to the correct page?
5. Tests edge cases scripted tests miss:
   - Click every button on every page
   - Try invalid inputs and verify error messages
   - Test navigation between pages
   - Verify all features in spec are reachable from the UI

**What this catches that scripted tests miss:**
- Stats page implemented but not wired to navigation
- Buttons with wrong sizes or misaligned layouts
- Login form that submits but doesn't redirect correctly
- Copy button that doesn't actually copy to clipboard
- Broken CSS/styling that doesn't affect test assertions

**When Playwright MCP is not available:** Layer 2 is skipped. The worker reports "Playwright MCP not installed — exploratory testing skipped" and passes with Layer 1 results only. Do NOT fail the eval just because Playwright MCP is missing.

**When the application won't start:** FAIL the eval. The application must start to be tested.

**PASS**: Scripted tests pass AND exploratory testing finds no issues.
**FAIL**: Any scripted test fails OR exploratory testing finds visual/behavioral bugs. Create fix job with screenshots and findings as evidence.

## Anti-Skip Enforcement
Evaluation is mandatory. Every job must pass Stage 1 and 1.5. Full mode requires Stage 3 (code critic), Stage 4 (test critic), and Stage 5 (agent-driven e2e). Both critics run in separate agent sessions with no access to the author's reasoning. The author cannot evaluate their own work.
